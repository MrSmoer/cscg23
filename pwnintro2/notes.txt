flag at stack base +fe3, need to print from fde, bc stuct takes length before
p (char*)getenv("FLAG")

--> we need to write stack addr of flag to the subtasks list

--> be able to write into subtask list
    we can free task in heap if we know heap address, then we allocate something different with stackaddr as smth we control
    -->
        leak heap addr
--> leak stack base
