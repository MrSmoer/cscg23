flag at stack base +fe3, need to print from fde, bc stuct takes length before
p (char*)getenv("FLAG")



vulnerabilites:
-unchecked subtask-deletion: we can index the tasks and or subtasks negatively
-unchecked task deletion: we can index the tasks negatively
-unchecked creation: we can create subtasks for negative tasks
-we can place subtask addresses on the task list
-_IO_2_1_stdout_ is before our tasks
-somehow strrchr didn't remove the \n, because there was one behind in heap

We just need one UAF

--> we need to write stack addr of flag to the subtasks list

--> be able to write into subtask list
    we can free task in heap if we know heap address, then we allocate something different with stackaddr as smth we control
    -->
        leak heap addr x
        --> heap addres shows up before begin of allocatable space, but this the double free protection
        --> make fake free task chunk, create new task into free chunk, subtasks will leak heap addr
--> leak stack base

okay, somehow the environ thing is not consistent, you need to paste the last address from terminal into python console, remove the last hex, increment the second to last, and add 3 zeros, enter, paste integer into console, works sometimes
